# moodle-assignsubmission_qrcode
Moodle Plugin that allows teachers to print QR Codes for an assignment. Learners can find and photograph these QR codes and will immediately submit a task as completed. It is possible to add a secret key as a fallback.
The idea was created at a meeting with Gerhard Schwed <gerhard.schwed@donau-uni.ac.at>.
